This lab is a little different, and a little harder, than previous labs. The Juice Shop is a web application created with many errors in it. It is specifically designed to teach you to recognize problems with Web Application Security. This lab is to demonstrate how a seemingly well-done web site can be a security nightmare.


Setup:

    Install git (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) if they are not installed.
        You may need to install vagrant guest additions. Use the following command from the command line: vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest.
    From powershell: Run `git clone https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop.git` -- This can take a few minutes
    From powershell cd into juice shop, then Run `cd vagrant`
    From powershell Run `vagrant up`--This can take a few minutes.
    When vagrant is finished: open a browser on your host and Browse to [192.168.33.10:3000](http://192.168.33.10:3000)

You should see a website as below:
