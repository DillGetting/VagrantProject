notes that are worthy about vagrantfile needs

webservers root document can be different

Define the HTML path and make certain that permissions do not allow users to move outside of those folders. 
Also, make sure the html path is not in root! Most web servers have quite a bit of flexibility in defining directories and access permissions. 
It is important to make use of these. Note: This is defined by the document root! Standard document root tends to be 
/var/www/html however this can change depending on the webserver
 (and version) used.
Similar to the first note above, keep in mind that you may need to segregate multiple sites on a single web server.
 This will often mean creating separate configs for each and, most certainly, storing files on each.



 Webserver, 
 	Idexpage, 404 errors
    USER is webdev Password 4TheWeb!
port 25

Database server
	mysqli-connect.php file for the database 
	user: dbdev 
	-p: 4TheDB

Client system for I am guessing the below stuff.
    user:Client Password:4TheClient
server monitoring everything.
	log tools
	manage other servers, can talk and listen to the other two
	need LOGS and STATISTICS from both servers.
I think this is the same machine from the server monitoring 
maybe not

File server with one shared network file. Like LVM was the hint.
